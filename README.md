# COBOL → PL/I Transition Manual
A Complete Professional Guide for Mainframe Developers

Welcome to the **COBOL → PL/I Transition Manual**, a comprehensive guide designed for COBOL programmers who must understand, maintain, or migrate PL/I systems on IBM mainframes.

This manual contains deep, production-quality explanations of every major language feature in PL/I with direct mappings to COBOL concepts.

## Purpose

COBOL and PL/I coexist in most large IBM z/OS environments. Many batch and online subsystems developed from the 1970s to today rely heavily on both languages.

This manual provides:

- A **feature-by-feature comparative reference**
- Fully explained PL/I examples
- Accurate equivalence mappings to COBOL
- Migration and translation strategies
- Detailed coverage of advanced PL/I topics

It serves as both a **learning resource** and a **work-ready reference manual**.
